For the commands I decided to go with :

1. Logout 
    -The command logs out of the Terminal
    -When I tried this, it fully closes the terminal on VSC
2. Echo
    - It takes in the strings and repeats it. 
3. Bye -> tcsh builtin
    -It is another way to exit that is only in tcsh builtin.
    -It exits the terminal.
4. Repeat
    -repeats the command for however many times indicated 
    - example given on website:
        -> repeat n command; Execute n instances of command
    -When I tested this, I used:
        - repeat 4 echo hi 
5. Type
    - type is a bash built in command 
    -it tells you the type of command you are asking it
    - for example: type exit will tell you exit is a built in command

6. Alias -> Bash
    - I was trying to get Alias to work to where it takes in an alias and when ever the alias is called, it will execute the command.
