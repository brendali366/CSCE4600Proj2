For the commands I decided to go with :

1. Alias -> bash
2. Echo
    - It takes in the strings and repeats it. 
3. Bye -> tcsh builtin
    -It is another way to exit that is only in tcsh builtin.
    -For "bye", I did not make a different function, as I used the import from os and just Exit program.
4. Repeat
    -repeats the command for however many times indicated 
    - example given on website:
        -> repeat n comman; Execute n instances of command
5. Type
    - type is a bash built in command 
    -it tells you the type of command you are asking it
    - for example: type exit will tell you exit is a built in command
